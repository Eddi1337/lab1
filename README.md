# COMP2203 Lab 1

Lab sheet - https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp2203/files/COMP2203-Lab-1.pdf

Please read the labs sheet carefully and follow the instructions.

## Preparation
To get started, you will need a Github account. We will assume you don't have one.

1. Browse to www.github.com.
2. Sign up for a free account.
  * Github is a hosting service for Git repositories, which also features many useful tools for managing your development project.
  * With a free account, you can create an unlimited number of publically-viewable repositories. 
  * Tip: If you sign up with your University email address, Github will give you five free private repositories (i.e. not publically-viewable).
  * Head over to www.github.com/edu after signing up to claim your free repositories.
3. Install the Github client on your iSolutions workstation. It can be found under “Additional Software”, from the Desktop.

You may fork this lab repo before the lab starts. It might just save you some time.
